# MY VSCODE

My VSCode is a project meant to be a Visual Studio Code visual copy with the purpose to showcase and store my settings, extensions and some other stuff.

## COMMANDS AND NAVIGATION

Some VSCode commands also work here, so you can navigate using `CTRL` + `P`  and see/run other available commands with `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `P`.
